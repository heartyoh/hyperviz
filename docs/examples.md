# HyperViz Example Code Core Concepts

This document explains the core concepts of the official examples provided by the `@hyperviz/worker` and `@hyperviz/weather` modules.

## @hyperviz/worker Examples

The `@hyperviz/worker` module provides examples in the `examples/` folder demonstrating various real-world use cases.

### Simple Calculation Worker (calc-worker-demo)

**Files:** `calc-worker-demo.html`, `simple-calc-worker.ts`

**Core Concepts:**

- Basic worker implementation that works in both web browsers and Node.js environments
- Processing simple operations like addition, multiplication, and factorial calculations in workers
- Request and response pattern between the main thread and workers
- Worker state monitoring (active tasks, processed task count, etc.)
- Error handling and logging mechanisms

This example demonstrates the basic asynchronous calculation pattern using workers, showing how to process CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the web application's UI.

### Event Stream (event-stream-example)

**Files:** `event-stream-example.ts`, `counter-stream-worker.ts`, `event-stream-counter.html`

**Core Concepts:**

- Continuous data stream transmission from workers to the main thread

This example shows how to perform large image processing tasks in workers to maintain UI responsiveness. This pattern can be used in image editing tools, photo filter applications, and more.

### Particle Effects (particle-effects-demo)

**Files:** `particle-effects-demo.html`

**Core Concepts:**

- Implementation of large-scale particle systems using workers
- Performance optimization by offloading physics calculations to workers
- Efficient state synchronization between main thread and workers
- High-performance animation rendering techniques
- Interactive particle simulation implementation

This example demonstrates how to handle complex simulations with thousands of particles while maintaining a smooth user experience. This pattern can be used for visual effects, data visualization, and interactive simulations.

### Real-time Data Processing (realtime-data)

**Files:** `realtime-data.html`, `data-processor-worker.ts`

**Core Concepts:**

- Real-time data stream processing and analysis
- Load balancing using worker pools
- Implementation of data filtering, aggregation, and transformation pipelines
- Real-time chart and dashboard updates
- Memory-efficient processing of large volumes of data

This example shows how to efficiently process and visualize continuous data streams. This pattern can be used for IoT monitoring, real-time analytics, financial data processing, and more.

## @hyperviz/weather Examples

The `@hyperviz/weather` module provides examples in the `examples/` folder demonstrating various weather visualization techniques.

### Wind Visualization Demo (wind-demo)

**Files:** `wind-demo/index.html`, `wind-demo/index.js`

**Core Concepts:**

- Visualizing wind flow using particle systems
- Rendering weather data on OpenLayers maps
- High-performance visualization processing using @hyperviz/worker
- Adjusting visualization parameters through user interfaces
- Real-time data updates and animations

This example provides an intuitive weather visualization by representing wind direction and strength with animated particles. Users can adjust parameters such as particle density, fade effect, and line width.

### Comprehensive Weather Example (index.html)

**Files:** `examples/index.html`, `examples/src/`

**Core Concepts:**

- Integration of multiple weather layers (wind, temperature, precipitation, clouds, solar radiation)
- UI controls for layer switching and combination
- Rendering optimization using OffscreenCanvas and web workers
- Mock weather data generation and visualization
- Responsive design and user experience optimization

This example demonstrates how to comprehensively visualize various weather elements. Users can switch between different weather layers and adjust settings.

## Common Core Concepts

The examples from both modules share the following common core concepts:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Processing CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main thread
2. **Optimized Data Transfer**: Efficient communication using Transferable objects
3. **Offscreen Rendering**: High-performance graphics processing using OffscreenCanvas
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous event handling and message passing
5. **Memory Management**: Efficient resource allocation and release
6. **Error Handling and Recovery**: Robust error handling mechanisms
7. **Scalable Design**: Flexible architecture that can adapt to various use cases

These examples demonstrate how to effectively use the @hyperviz libraries in production environments and provide best practices for reference in real application development.
